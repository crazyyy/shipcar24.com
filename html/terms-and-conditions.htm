Transport Management Company registered with the USDOT with a broker 
license number 2239816. This agreement is between solely the customer 
and his, her or its duly authorized agents, (hereinafter referred to as 
"Customer"), and <strong>Montway, Inc. (DBA Montway Auto Transport)</strong>.

		</p><h3>Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</h3>

		<p>The option to cancel a shipping order is available at any time, at 
no cost and with no cancellation fee, as long as the order has not yet 
been assigned (dispatched) to a Carrier (transporter). Our services are 
considered rendered when a Carrier (transporter) is assigned to an 
order.</p>

        <p>Refunds will be processed within 48 business hours of the cancellation request.</p>

        <p>Cancellation of an order must be submitted in writing via email sent to info@montway.com. <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> does not accept or honor cancellations made via phone call.</p>

        <p>Once a Carrier (transporter) has been assigned (dispatched) to a shipping order, <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> notifies Customer via email (to the email address provided at service booking).</p>

        <p>If Customer decides to cancel the shipping order after a 
Carrier (transporter) has been assigned (dispatched), $199 cancellation 
fee will be assessed, as our services have been rendered. Any remaining 
balance will be refunded in full.</p>


        <h3>Contract Terms and Liability Disclaimer</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Carrier will pick up and deliver as close to Customer's 
door as legally and safely as possible. A mutually agreed upon place to 
load or unload the vehicle(s) may be necessary due to low hanging trees,
 low hanging wires, narrow streets and residential area restrictions.</li>

            <li><strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> shall provide Customer 
with an estimated pickup and estimated delivery date. However, delays 
may occur prior to, and/or during, transport due to weather, road 
conditions, mechanical problems, etc. There are absolutely no guarantees
 regarding pickup or delivery times and dates. <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier
 shall not be held responsible for loss or damages occasioned by delays 
of any kind or for any reason, car rental fees or any accommodation 
fees. <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier shall not be held liable for failure of mechanical or operating parts of Customer's vehicle.</li>

            <li><strong>Carrier</strong> is authorized to operate and 
transport Customer's motor vehicle between its pickup location and the 
destination set forth on the shipping order and Bill of Lading.</li>

            <li>Customer must prepare vehicle for transport. All loose 
parts, fragile accessories, low hanging spoilers, etc. must be removed 
or secured. Customer shall remove all non-permanent, outside mounted 
luggage and other racks prior to shipment. Vehicles must be tendered to 
Carrier in good running condition (unless otherwise noted) with no more 
than a half tank of fuel (preferably 1/4 tank). Any part of the vehicle 
that falls off during transport is Customer's responsibility including 
damages caused by said part to any vehicles(s) and/or person involved.</li>

            <li>Customer must disarm any alarm system installed in the 
vehicle or provide proper instructions for this matter. In the event 
said alarm sounds and there are no keys or instructions to turn it off, 
Carrier may silence alarm by any means.</li>

            <li>Luggage and personal property must be confined to one 
suitcase OR one bag in the trunk only, with no heavy articles, and is 
not to exceed 100 lbs. Carrier and <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> are 
not liable for personal items left in vehicle, nor for damage to vehicle
 caused by excessive or improper loading of personal items. No personal 
property shall be transported in customer's vehicle(s) that includes, 
but is not limited to, Explosives, Guns, Ammunition, Flammable Products,
 Narcotics, Negotiable and Legal Papers, Alcoholic Beverages, Jewelry, 
Furs, Money, Live Pets, Live Plants or any unlawful contraband. Customer
 agrees that <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier may confiscate or dispose of said items with no remuneration. <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier
 will not be held responsible for delivery of personal property. If 
Customer wishes to put items in the vehicle, he does so at his own risk.</li>

            <li>International Orders: the car must be empty except for 
factory installed equipment. Indicate the serial number and give car's 
approximate value in U.S. dollars. Customer is responsible for the 
proper customs paperwork. (Ask the assigned Carrier for help with these 
documents.) Any order placed on our website that has a pickup and/or 
delivery location, such as a port, will be subject to an additional 
charge of $100. The booked price on our website https://www.montway.com 
does not include the extra charge of $100.</li>

            <li>If the vehicle is inoperable or oversized (dual or 
oversized wheels, extra-large, racks, lifted, limo, etc.) Customer must 
inquire as to the extra charges. If <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> is 
not advised of inoperable or oversized/modified vehicles prior to 
pickup, all extra charges must be paid in cash or money order to the 
Carrier upon delivery.</li>

            <li>Customer agrees that <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> has the right to reject (cancel) any order for any reason at any time.</li>

            <li>At the time of pickup, Customer and Carrier will 
carefully inspect the vehicle for pre-existing damage (exterior only) by
 completing a vehicle inspection report recorded on the Bill of Lading. 
Carrier and Customer will both acknowledge the condition of the vehicle 
and Customer will sign and receive a copy of the Bill of Lading.</li>

            <li>At the time of delivery, Customer and Carrier will 
carefully inspect the vehicle for possible damages incurred during 
transit. Carrier and Customer will both acknowledge the condition of the
 vehicle and Customer will sign and receive a final copy of the Bill of 
Lading.
            <br><br>

            Damage must be noted in the proper place on the Bill of 
Lading and signed by Customer regardless of weather conditions, time of 
day or day of week. Signing the Bill of Lading and inspection report 
without notation of any damage verifies that Customer has received his 
vehicle(s) in satisfactory condition, and that Montway, Inc./Carrier and
 their agents are relieved of any further responsibility. Carrier damage
 claims are covered by a minimum of $750000 public liability and 
property damage. All claims must be submitted in writing within 24 hours
 of delivery. <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> will share the Carrier insurance policy details upon request. Customer agrees that <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> is not liable for any property damage claims to Customer’s vehicle and that his, her or its sole remedy is against the Carrier.
            <br><br>

            Customer agrees and understands that Montway, Inc. is a 
registered transportation and property broker and is acting solely in 
the capacity of a broker. Customer allows Montway, Inc. to contract with
 other licensed and insured Motor Carrier(s), (hereinafter referred to 
as "Carrier"), to transport the vehicle(s) described in this shipping 
order. Montway, Inc. and Carrier reserve the right to use multiple modes
 of transportation, including but not limited to truck, rail and ship.
            <br><br>

            Customer further agrees and understands that Montway, Inc.’s
 sole responsibility in the transaction between the customer and 
Montway, Inc. is to procure a carrier for shipment of the customer’s 
property. Customer understands that Montway never takes possession of, 
transports, or delivers the Customer’s property.
            <br><br>

            Customer agrees and understands that all claims for damage 
to property arising out or occurring during the taking possession of, 
transporting, or delivery of Customer’s property falls under the Carmack
 Amendment, if the transport is interstate.
            <br><br>

            As outlined in Section 10761 of the Interstate Commerce Act (<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-1994-title49/html/USCODE-1994-title49-subtitleIV-chap107-subchapIV-sec10761.htm" target="_blank">49 USC 10761</a>)
 the payment of freight charges may not be postponed due to alleged loss
 or damage. These charges should be paid in full and the portion 
applicable to the lost or damaged item should be included in the freight
 claim.
            <br><br>

            The following items are important to remember:<br>
            a) Claims and payment of freight charges are two entirely different transactions.<br>
            b) ICC regulations prohibit withholding the payment of freight bills due to a pending claim. (<a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2007-07-05/pdf/E7-11717.pdf" target="_blank">Administrative Ruling No. 128</a>)<br>
            c) Without payment of the freight charges, payment for 
transportation has not been made. A valid claim will not be paid until 
freight charges are made.<br>
            </li>

            <li>Carrier accepts responsibility of vehicle after 
pre-inspection is done and Bill of Lading is signed by the Customer. 
Carrier responsibility will end when the vehicle is delivered and 
Customer signs final Bill of Lading inspection.</li>

            <li><strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier will not be 
responsible for damage caused by acts of God, hail or storm damage, or 
damage resulting from worn/broken parts of vehicle or added personal 
items.</li>

            <li>Customer shall, in their absence, designate a person to 
act as their agent at the point of pickup and/or delivery if for any 
reason they are unavailable.</li>

            <li>Customer warrants that he/she will pay the full transportation price due to <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>/Carrier
 in full and will not try to offset any dispute for damage claims and/or
 delays etc. from freight (transport) charges. It is Customer's 
responsibility to provide payment when Carrier arrives- unless the 
balance has been pre-paid in full. All payments to Carrier on orders 
booked as "Discounted Cash Price" must be in the form of cash, cashier's
 check or money order - no exceptions. Certified funds must be made 
payable to the delivering Carrier and not to <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>
 Personal checks, debit or credit cards for orders booked as "Discounted
 Cash Price" will NOT be accepted for the remaining balance - no 
exceptions. Customer agrees that if the payment cannot be made by these 
methods, the vehicle will be stored, at Customer's expense, until 
Customer pays in full all transport charges. Should Customer be unable 
to accept delivery for any reason, the vehicle will be placed in 
storage. Any and all storage and re-delivery charges will be the 
responsibility of Customer.</li>
            
            <li>This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois.</li>

            <li>The parties here agree that all actions or proceedings 
arising in connection to this agreement shall be tried and litigated 
exclusively in the State or Federal (if permitted by law and a party 
elects to file an action in federal court) courts located in Cook 
County, in the state of Illinois. This choice of venue is intended by 
the parties to be mandatory and not permissive in nature, and to 
preclude the possibility of litigation between the parties with respect 
to, or arising out of, this Agreement in any jurisdiction other than 
that specified in this section. Each party waives any right it may have 
to assert the doctrine of forum non-convenience or similar doctrine or 
to object to venue with respect to any proceeding brought in accordance 
with this section. By action of this provision, the parties agree to 
submit to the personal jurisdiction of the aforementioned court.</li>

            <li>Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>
 from any and all actual or alleged claims, demands, causes of action, 
liability, loss, damage and/or injury (to property or persons, including
 without limitation wrongful death), whether brought by an individual or
 other entity, imposed by a court of law or by administrative action of 
any federal state or local agency, arising out of or incident to any 
acts, omissions, negligence, or willful misconduct of <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>, or the Carrier, its personnel, employees, agents, or contractors in connection with or arising out of <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>
 or the Carrier’s actions. The indemnification includes, without 
limitation, the payment of all penalties, fines, judgments, awards, 
attorney’s fees, and related costs or expenses, and any reimbursements 
to <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> for all legal expenses and costs incurred by it.</li>

            <li>Neither party may assign, directly or indirectly, all or
 part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the 
prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld or delayed.</li>

            <li>Invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the 
provisions in this Agreement shall not affect any other provisions of 
this Agreement.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This agreement and any shipment here under is subject to all 
terms and conditions of Carrier's tariff and the uniform straight Bill 
of Lading, copies of which are available at the office of Carrier.
This supersedes all prior written or oral representation of <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> and constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>
 and may not be changed except in writing signed by an officer of 
Montway. Inc. Customer warrants that he, she or it has read this 
agreement in its entirety and by continuing with the transaction, fully 
understands and agrees to its terms. Further, Customer waives any claims
 or defenses based in whole or in part on not reading, knowing, or 
understanding these terms and conditions and agrees to indemnify and 
hold harmless <strong>Montway, Inc.</strong> for any fees or costs, 
including attorney’s fees and costs, arising out of any claims or 
defenses asserted based upon not reading, having knowledge of, or 
understanding these terms and conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Montway, Inc.</strong>'s U.S. Department of Transportation Broker's license number is <strong>2239816</strong>.</p>
