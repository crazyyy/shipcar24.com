If you only know the city we can still calculate a quote that is just as acurate as if we had a zip code. If you only know roughly where it is being shipped to or from, use a major city you think you might be shipping to or from to get a good idea of what it will cost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We suggest you make sure the car is clean so that any existing damage is fully visible. Remove any personal items, especially anything of value. If there are any external modifications to the vehicle such as a roof rack which can be removed, they should be removed and stored inside the vehicle if they will fit. As a precaution, it&#8217;s a good idea to cover or wrap your driver seat and driver-side floor mat just in case the trucker gets any dirt in the vehicle while loading or unloading. Remove any automatic toll devices and disable any kind of security devices which could give the trucker trouble when loading or unloading the vehicle. Finally, try to leave a quarter tank of gas in the vehicle to be sure there is enough for loading and unloading but not so much to start adding extra weight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes and No. You don&#8217;t personally need to be there but it is highly recommended that you have a representative at both pickup and delivery if you cannot be there personally. The representative must be at least 18 years of age. At both pickup and delivery you or your representative will need to inspect the vehicle and mark any damage on the Bill of Lading before signing it. At pickup you are looking for any pre-existing damage and at delivery you will note any new damage that occurred during transport.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bill of Lading is an important document used in the auto transport industry as well as other forms of cargo shipping. The bill of lading is a legal document which will specify exactly what vehicle is to be transported from location A to location B and by whom. It will document the condition of the vehicle before it is turned over to the trucker at pickup and then document the condition again before it is turned over to the owner at delivery. The bill of lading serves as the contract between the trucker and the vehicle owner and includes the terms of that agreement. The final function of the Bill of Lading is as a receipt for the transaction. While the customer booking the transaction or the owner of the vehicle does not need to be at pickup nor delivery to sign the Bill of Lading personally, it is highly recommended that a representative who is at least 18 years of age is there to sign it because it is an important legal document for the transaction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terminal-to-Terminal means the customer is responsible for dropping off a vehicle at a terminal closest to the pickup location and then also responsible for picking it up at a terminal closet to the delivery location. Terminal-to-terminal shipping typically takes at least twice as long as Door-to-Door shipping because a vehicle must wait at one or more terminal locations until there are enough vehicles to fill out a truck. A vehicle is also more likely to be moved on and off trucks which is where damage most frequently occurs (loading and unloading). With door-to-door transport the same truck and driver will pickup and delivery your vehicle as close as legally and safely possible to your pickup and delivery address. Montway only offers Door-to-Door service. If you have a rural pickup or delivery location you can meet a trucker near an interstate or larger city to save considerable cost over what would normally be a higher rate for a rural pickup or delivery.</p>

Occasionally customers must meet a trucker nearby the pickup or delivery location if the road are narrow or there are low-hanging trees. In these cases, the trucker will still get as close as legally and safely possible. If you live in a rural location that is accessible but out of the way you have the option to meet the trucker near an interstate or major city which will reduce the cost of transport. This is by no means required for rural locations, just an option.</p>
