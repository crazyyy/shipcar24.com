				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes. If the roof rack can be removed and put inside the trunk or back seat of the vehicle (possibly with the back seats down) there is no additional cost or steps needed.  Just remove the rack before pickup. If it cannot be easily removed let us know and we&#8217;ll tell you how much more, if any, it will cost. Depending on the total height of the vehicle with the roof rack the cost may be higher because it will mean that the car will end up taking more space on the transport truck where any additional space is at a premium.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Yes, however any vehicle with clearance lower than 4 inches will likely need to be shipped on an enclosed trailer with a lift-gate. Low clearance vehicles simply cannot be driven onto an open trailer because the car would bottom-out on the un-even ramps.</p>
