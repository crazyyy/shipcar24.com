				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will email you a copy of the quote which will lock in your quoted price for up to 7 days should you choose to book at a later date. Even if your quote expires the details are saved and can be quickly recalculated if you wish to book after 7 days. Unlike many other auto transport sites we don&#8217;t require a name and phone number to get a quote. We also will not spam you nor will we sell your email address to anyone. If you prefer not to give an email address, feel free to give us a call at 1-888-MONTWAY (666-8929) and we&#8217;ll give you a customized quote over the phone with no personal details necessary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some popular vehicles like a Ford Mustang or Chevy Corvette have been around for several decades and we will ship both old and new versions of these cars. Older cars typically weigh considerably more than their newer counterparts and weight is a big component of the cost of shipping. Similarly, we also DO NOT look at the relative wealth of the zip codes of the route to charge more for higher income pickup or delivery areas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a vehicle to be considered operable it must be able to drive in forward and reverse under its own power and steer. If any of these conditions are not met it is considered inoperable. Basically, if a car can be driven on and off a transport truck with no additional work on the part of the trucker then it&#8217;s an operable vehicle. If the trucker must push or winch the vehicle onto the truck it&#8217;s inoperable and a trucker will want to be paid more to perform these additional services. Not all transport trucks can accommodate inoperable vehicles so pickup may take longer for an inoperable vehicle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We will start with the vehicle details from your quote. If you call to place an order we may be able to lookup a quote you got online. We&#8217;ll need to know the year of the vehicle and the full pickup and delivery addresses. We&#8217;ll need your phone number in case we need to get in touch with you. We&#8217;ll also need the name and at least one phone number for the pickup and delivery contact if it will be someone other than you. Finally we need a credit card to put on file. We authorize the card at the time you give it to us to make sure it was entered correctly but there is no charge and no hold until we schedule a trucker for pickup and provide you with his name and number. If you&#8217;re booking in advance this won&#8217;t happen until a few days before your first available date at the absolute earliest. If you are placing an order that is available to be picked up immediately, it can take up to five days until your card will be charged. If you chose to pay with PayPal instead, either the partial payment or the pay-in-full option will need to be paid at the time of booking.</p>
