Older cars typically weigh considerably more than their newer counterparts and weight is a big component of the cost of shipping. Similarly, we also DO NOT look at the relative wealth of the zip codes of the route to charge more for higher income pickup or delivery areas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a vehicle to be considered operable it must be able to drive in forward and reverse under its own power and steer. If any of these conditions are not met it is considered inoperable. Basically, if a car can be driven on and off a transport truck with no additional work on the part of the trucker then it&#8217;s an operable vehicle. If the trucker must push or winch the vehicle onto the truck it&#8217;s inoperable and a trucker will want to be paid more to perform these additional services. Not all transport trucks can accommodate inoperable vehicles so pickup may take longer for an inoperable vehicle.</p>
