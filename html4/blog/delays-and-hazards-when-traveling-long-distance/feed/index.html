People often think that it would be easier, cheaper and faster to drive their car to the new place than to trust it in the hands of an auto transporter. It may be true sometime, but it all depends on the situation and the car shipping company you have chosen. That is why it is good to work with brokers and tell them your requirements as they can better accommodate you. If you are on a time schedule, and need your car fast, you may want to consider expedite car-shipping service instead of racing with your car across the country and risking delays and hazards of traveling long distance.
