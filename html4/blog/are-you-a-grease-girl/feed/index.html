		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what Guest&#039;s intention was, but in any field where a group of people are discriminated against, that group of people have to be BETTER than average to break into that industry. 

 If any women are looking for what kinds of motor vehicle career paths are available for you, this is a helpful article: http://www.jobs.net/Article/CB-96-Talent-Network-Transpt-Logistics-4-Different-Career-Paths-for-Motor-Vehicle-Workers/

I&#039;m more familiar with women working behind the desk at the mechanic&#039;s so my guess is that the auto mechanic industry is no exception, with women needing to successfully combat and disprove the negative stereotypes and can&#039;t afford to be average.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is it that the guest like so many others can&#039;t be satisfied with saying that women are doing just as good a job as men. No they have to claim as Guest did above that in many cases women do it better.? Guest writes as if she realy doesn&#039;t want equality because we should all want the best person for the job and since in many cases women do the job better than only women should have the job.
Her comment is sexist.women are showing themselves to have just as big egoes as men.]]></description>
